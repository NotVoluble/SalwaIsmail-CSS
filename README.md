# Salwa Ismail-CSS Dissertation
Data and model written for the various sections in my PhD dissertation for CSS.

There are three sections in my dissertation, and there is data and/or code associated with each of them. 
Contact me at <sismail4@gmu.edu> if you'd like to extend the datasets or have questions about the datasets. 

Section 1: I take a CAS approach. to  first explore the sizes of U.S universities and document significant positive correlation among important variables like acceptance rates, locations in urban/rural settings, the presence of law and medical schools, research and development expenditures, and sizes of host cities/locales

Section 2: I use computational social science (CSS) ideas to look for signatures of complexity in data on U.S. universities. Specifically, power-law size distributions are found in certain financial aspects of university performance â€“ the distribution of endowments.

Section 3: I develop a computational ABM that reproduces some of these patterns of size and growth of universities, based on R&D investment and interactions among competing universities.

The datasets created are for enrollment and endowments are shared here as csv files. Each file has multiple datasets within based on groups described in the data files.

The code for ABM is also shared. It uses Netlogo 6.4.
